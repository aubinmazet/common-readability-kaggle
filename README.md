# common-readability-kaggle

Currently, most educational texts are matched to readers using traditional readability methods or commercially available formulas. However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number or words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity.

The goal of this competition was to build an algorithm to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use.
